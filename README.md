# MyProjects
Brief showcase of my projects

1. Household Income Hackathon

We collaborated on Github in this project, however the files was not organised too nicely during the hackathon, hence I have cleaned it up to the following version I present you. I do have some minor experience in using git, notably git pull, git add, git commit and git push, through this project :)

General Ideas of the project:
Developed a ML model in predicting incomes in Californian household based on social factors predictors (race, gender, age, etc). Aim to show the existence of income inequality through embedding the model on a webpage and allowing people to come calculate their predicted income after they entered their information, and show what are other "similar" people earning if they are a different race/gender, the idea is to spread awareness about this wage gap.

Mainly used gradient boosted trees for our model. We worked in a team of 4, not all code are developed by me. I mainly contributed it writing the code to train the model in (xgboost.ipynb), while also contributed to cleaning some of the data.

The long list of python notebooks are used to clean/filter the data and output a corresponding csv file for data to be trained. The original sets of data could be find on the folder 'train', with a short readme.txt instruction written by the project creator back then.

The final presentation consist of a webpage developed by an other teammate that has experience in web dev and in the folder 'Demo Image', you can find some of the snap shots of the webpage to get a picture of our whole project.


2. Imperial Machine Learning Project

THIS PROJECT IS WRITTEN IN R. (As my methods for data science course are taught in R.)

Despite this being not Python, I included this as I feel that the ML project that I have done in Python (the Hackathon Project) do not do justice to my ability to develop ML model (in Python). This project consist of using various ML models to classify patient's drug consumption pattern based on their psychometric score.

Please find a more complete description of the dataset in the 'C1 - MachineLearning.pdf' file, as desired. Also the data files are included as .rdata files

General Ideas of the project:
K-means clustering method are used to identify clusters of drug consumption patterns. Assuming these consumption patterns exist, ML model is built to predict the patient drug consumption habits based on the rest of the predictors. ML model I implemented/test (from a library) for this classification task includes Random Forrest, KNN, Logistic Regression

I also applied PCA in the process for some variable selection as well as data exploration.

The 'Final_Report.html', showcase all the code and the different ML models I implemented to build such a model.

For brief overview of my project before diving into the details, I recommend starting with briefly looking at the 'Final_poster.pdf' first.

The .Rmd file could be run by Rmarkdown.


3. Oxford Machine Learning Assignments

Finally, I attached my current Oxford ML class assignments as reference for the ML model that I am currently implementing particularly in Python. Some notable algorithm that we will be learning to implement in python are SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, Neutral Networks  and KNN.

I am confident the R code I showed in my imperial Project could be adapted with relatively low effort to Python, after this course. The two assignments that I attached, hopefully would give you a good picture of my progress in the course so far, although with experience in project 1 and 2, writing these codes are not too challenging.

The data files are self contained in the folders.
